    <h2> Data </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="marginnote">HMDA did not record whether loans were for site-built or mobile homes before 2004. I train a classifier on loan-level data from 2004-2017 and use it to impute the type of home for the period 1990-2003 when that information is otherwise unavailable. The classifier accurately predicts loan type in the validation set and is consistent with independent data from the Census Bureau. </span>
