summary: "I present a novel stylized fact about the geography of mobile homes: their prevalence doubles at municipal boundaries relative to site-built homes. This pattern is widespread across the U.S. and cannot be explained by changes in demographics or other observable characteristics. I argue that the discontinuity is driven by municipal zoning regulations which impose differential costs on mobile homes. I test this theory with a boundary regression discontinuity design, quantifying the impact of municipal regulations on mobile home shares and prices. Using my RDD estimates, I then calibrate a CES model of housing demand. I find that the average municipality imposes an implicit tax on mobile homes of roughly 10%. However, the welfare effects are muted because similar site-built homes are close substitutes."
