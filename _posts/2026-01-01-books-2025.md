# What I Learned

* Eligibility for welfare programs is hard to determine. To economize on this cost, some administrators argue for a simple initial screen like "Made less than $X last month? You may be eligible." While a handful of applicants will ultimately be ineligible, the question offers a quick way for households to decide whether completing the full application is worth their time. The old application for SNAP benefits in California, for instance, involved answering 212 questions, uploading multiple documents, and then waiting for a phone interview. From [Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better](https://www.amazon.com/Recoding-America-Government-Failing-Digital/dp/1250266777) (Jennifer Pahlka, 2023).

* The largest bill in circulation in China is the 100 yuan note, or about $13 USD. This makes storing cash difficult for corrupt officials. In January 2005, the vice chief of the Wuhan Railway Burueau was caught with 50 million dollars in cash, real estate, jewelry, and art that he had accumulated through embezzling ticket sales. His mountains of cash were so large and unruly that the bills had started to rot.
