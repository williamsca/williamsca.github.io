Shortly after arriving in DC, I asked a retired bookseller to
recommend books about the city, in any genre. I've since added a number of my own finds to this list, which I
present in the hopes that other residents of our capital will find it
useful in developing an appreciation for the history and beauty of the
city of Washington.

1. [Reveille in Washington:
   1860-1865](https://www.amazon.com/Reveille-Washington-1860-1865-Review-Classics/dp/1590174461)
   (Margaret Leech, 1941. 524pp). The Civil War transforms a sleepy backwater
   into the center of the Union's war effort. 

2. [Lincoln in the
   Bardo](https://www.amazon.com/Lincoln-Bardo-Novel-George-Saunders/dp/0812995341)
   (George Saunders, 2017. 368pp). Willie Lincoln was temporarily interred in Oak
   Hill Cemetery in Georgetown during the Civil War, and Lincoln visited
   on several occasions to hold the body of his child. Saunders writes
   a moving narrative about the President's grief.

3. [The Five of Hearts: An Intimate Portrait of Henry Adams and His
Friends,
1880-1918](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Hearts-Intimate-Portrait-1880-1918/dp/0743288238)
(Patricia O'Toole, 2006. 459pp). Describes the social circle of Henry Adams, the grandson of
presidents and an acute observer of political life. 

4. [Spring in
   Washington](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Washington-Maryland-Paperback-Bookshelf/dp/0801836522)
   (Louis J. Halle, 1947. 252pp). A bureaucrat during the Second World War
   observes the changing on the seasons. While Halle sometimes makes
   dangerous forays into philosophizing, his description of the birds,
   plants, and weather gives one a persistent itch to bike along the
   Mount Vernon trail.

5. [First Class: The Legacy of Dunbar, America's First Black Public
   High
   School](https://www.amazon.com/First-Class-Legacy-Dunbar-Americas/dp/1613731760)
   (Alison Stewart, 2013. 352pp). How does an all-black school during
   the 1950s compete with and even outperform the best white schools
   in the city? Stewart describes the culture of excellence at a
   school that
   produced educators, lawyers, academics, and politicians and engendered a deep
   loyalty among its graduates.
