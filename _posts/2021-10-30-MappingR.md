My pre-calculus teacher was fond of pointing out that there are many ways to get to the local Dairy Queen. This fact of geography might easily be verified by inspecting a map, but of course there are also many, many ways to create a map. This is one such recipe for mapping roadways in **R** using _ggplot2_.

## A minimal example
Navigate your browser to [http://download.geofabrik.de/](http://download.geofabrik.de/) and download the _.shp_ file for the region of interest. The data include information on the geography and built environment of the region. For those regions with distinctive water features, a reasonable map may be obtained with just the water and roads shapefiles. I'll use Washington, DC as an example:

## The method

Import the raw water and roads shapefiles as spatial dataframes using _rgdal_:

```R
library(data.table, sf, rgdal, ggplot2)

shp.water <- rgdal::readOGR(
	              dsn = ".../district-of-columbia-latest-free.shp", 
                  layer = "gis_osm_water_a_free_1")

shp.roads <- rgdal::readOGR(
	              dsn = ".../district-of-columbia-latest-free.shp", 
                  layer = "gis_osm_roads_free_1")
```

Its easier to live in _ggplot2_ world if we have dataframes. Use the _fortify()_ method to convert the spatial data to vanilla dataframes (NB: _broom::tidy()_ is an alternative to _fortify_).


```R
df.water <- ggplot2::fortify(shp.water)
df.roads <- ggplot2::fortify(shp.roads)
```

It's worth taking a closer look at _df.roads_:

Each road segment is an ordered collection of points. The particular segment is identified by the _group_ field. The water data is similar except that each collection of points represents a polygon instead of a line. Plotting these objects is relatively simple:


```R
ggplot() + 
  
  # road network
  geom_path(data = df.roads,
               aes(group = group, x = long, y = lat),
               colour = "gray", alpha = .8) +
  
  # water
  geom_polygon(data = df.water,
               aes(group = group, x = long, y = lat),
               fill  = "lightblue") + 
  
  # cleaning up
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-77.1, -77.0), ylim = c(38.85, 38.95)) +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave(".../output.png")
```

The _geom\_path()_ method takes a collection of points and plots them in the order they appear in the data. The crucial option here is _aes(group = group, ...)_; it prevents unrelated roads from being connected. The _geom\_polygon()_ method does the same thing, but it also connects the first and last points and allows the inside to be colored using _fill_.

Particular locations may be added using _geom\_point()_.
