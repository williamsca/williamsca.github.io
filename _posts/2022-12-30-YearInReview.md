It was a good year for reading: I have not read so many pages since my heady first semesters of college in 2015.

I spent much of this year thinking about, in Tyler Cowen's phrase, the "production function" of famous intellectuals. Where do their ideas come from, and what is required to catapult an idea from a single mind into the world?

1. [The Club: Johnson, Boswell, and the Friends Who Shaped an Age](https://www.amazon.com/Club-Johnson-Boswell-Friends-Shaped/dp/0300251785)(Leo Damrosch, 2020). Afflicted by depression, the bachelor Samuel Johnson forms a weekly dinner club of convivial and interesting friends. The club later grew to include such luminaries as Edward Gibbon and Adam Smith.

2. [The Magician](https://www.amazon.com/Magician-Novel-Colm-Toibin/dp/1476785082)(Colm Toibin, 2021). A dramatic account of the life of the German author and Nobel laureate Thomas Mann.

3. [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041)(Richard Feynman, 1985). Scientific insight comes from a place of childlike wonder and play.

4. [Finding Equilibrium:  Arrow, Debreu, McKenzie and the Problem of Scientific Credit](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Equilibrium-McKenzie-Problem-Scientific/dp/0691156646)(Till Duppe and E. Roy Weintraub, 2014). Economists -- and few others -- may find this history of interest.

5. [Of Human Bondage](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Bondage-Classic-Illustrated/dp/1689208694/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)(W. Somerset Maugham, 1915). This novel is underrated. Some of its best scenes describe the mental gymnastics employed by a group of art students in Paris who dream of greatness despite overwhelming evidence of their own mediocrity.
