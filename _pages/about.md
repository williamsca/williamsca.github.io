I am a graduate student in economics at the University of Virginia. My research interests include urban and public economics.

I'm now curious about [why people move to cities](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2018/eb_18-10) and the interactions between [public spending and private amenities]().

You can find my CV [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1rhdbw4yjebvw27/Resume.pdf?dl=0)
