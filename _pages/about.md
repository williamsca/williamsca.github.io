I am a second-year PhD student in economics at the University of Virginia. My research interests include urban and public economics. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1rhdbw4yjebvw27/Resume.pdf?dl=0).

I'm now curious about [why people move to cities](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2018/eb_18-10) and the interactions between [public spending and private amenities](https://dhcd.virginia.gov/governor-glenn-youngkin-announces-over-115-million-community-development-block-grants).
