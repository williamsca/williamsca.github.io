I am a graduate student in economics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. My wife and I spend much of our time keeping our toddler alive and happy, and consequently we are eager to welcome our second child later this year.

Although I was born in Wichita, Kansas, I attended college in Western Massachusetts and worked in antitrust consulting in Washington, DC before moving to Virginia.

I am sometimes on Twitter under the handle [@platonicpicnic](https://x.com/platonicpicnic). I also maintain a website of family recipes at [https://williamsca.github.io/recipes/](https://williamsca.github.io/recipes/).
