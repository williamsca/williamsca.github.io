What role do public sector unions play in determining the local government spending priorities? In this essay, I discuss a trio of recent papers that shed light on this question. Each explores a different source of monopoly power that allows unions to extract rents in the form of higher wages.

Not all states allow public employees to bargain collectively: ...

## Transfers from Uncle Sam

Suppose a city government finds a dollar bill on the ground (or, equivalently, that they receive an unexpected transfer from the federal government). What will they do? Rather than returning the money to residents in the form of lower taxes, Feiveson (2015) shows that they spend it. Interestingly, *how* they spend it depends on state laws that govern public sector unions. When unions are strong, the extra cash goes to higher wages for public employees; when they are weak, jurisdictions instead hire more employees and invest in infrastructure.

Feiveson exploits geographic variation in federal transfers due to the allocation formulas in President Nixon's State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972. These transfers, which comprised roughly 3% of local budgets each year until 1986, were intended to move spending decisions "closer to the people." Congressional horse-trading led to a geographically-tiered formula that first allocated funds to state areas, then across county areas within the state, and only then across local governments the county. The result: two similar cities could receive vastly different amounts of money depending on the state and county that they happened to be in.

After showing that $1 of transfers from this program lead to about $1 of additional spending, Feiveson breaks down spending into four categories: wages, employment, capital outlays, and everything else. She then interacts the amount of federal transfers with an indicator for whether the state requires collective bargaining or not. The key results appear in Table 9 and are copied below:

While cities in pro-union states spend about $0.78 of the extra dollar on wages, those in anti-union states spend merely $0.14, with the rest going to employment and capital outlays.

While Feiveson emphasizes the implications of her results for macroeconomic policy and spending multipliers, I think the more interesting lesson is what we learn about the nature of local governments. Cities are sometimes viewed as firms whose shareholders are their residents (hence, a municipal *corporation*). When firms receive a dollar in windfall profits, we expect them to return it to their shareholders either via dividends or stock buybacks. The fact that cities *don't* distribute windfall gains to residents by lowering taxes tells us something about who their true "shareholders" are.

## Local Amenities

A place with great weather, beautiful beaches, or a natural harbor can count on a steady stream of residents even if the local government is inefficient. Brueckner and Neumark (2014) push this idea a step further: do public employees actively exploit natural amenities to raise their wages without providing additional services?

In the spirit of Buchanan, Brueckner and Neumark develop a model where public employees control the local government and choose their own wages. Public employees face the same trade-off as any monopolist: raising taxes yields more revenue per resident, but it leads some residents to move elsewhere. The model's key prediction is that amenities will increase the wages of public sector workers both absolutely and relative to private sector workers. 

Brueckner and Nuemark test this prediction with a Mincer-style wage regression using CPS data. They include standard demographics controls plus measures of local amenities, an indicator for public sector status, and their interaction. If public sector workers are able to generate rents from local amenities, this interaction should be positive: nice weather + public employee = higher (relative) wages. And that's exactly what they find.
