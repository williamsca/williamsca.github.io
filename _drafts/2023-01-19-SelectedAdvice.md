Advice, both solicited and not, is pervasive in economics graduate programs. Jennifer Doleac curates a nice selection of resources that spans finding a pre-doc to earning tenure on her [webpage](http://jenniferdoleac.com/resources/). At the risk of further congesting the waters, I have collected a few of my own suggestions below.

### General
- Discussion and debate are fundamental to the research process. In order to maximize the probability of participating in fruitful discussions, it is helpful if one can recall key concepts in real time. Experiment with spaced repitition software like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). If you are not convinced about the virtues of memory training, Michael Nielsen writes persuasively on the subject [here](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

- Experimental evidence suggests that texts read in print are comprehended better than those read digitally.^[1] Although printing physical copies of academic articles may be impractical, a second-best solution is to send pdfs to an e-reader. Amazon will [convert](https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-PDF-to-Kindle-Format) the file to its Kindle format, permitting one to re-size the text, and their software does a decent job at capturing figures and charts. 

### During undergrad

- Many programs will ask you to indicate the textbooks that you used in your undergraduate mathematics courses. Keep a record now rather than tracking them down years later.
