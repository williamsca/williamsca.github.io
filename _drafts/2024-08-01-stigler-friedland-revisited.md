Prior to 1962, many economists took it as given that utility regulators kept prices low. Absent regulation, utilities would inevitably leverage their status as "natural monopolies" to charge high prices, providing a clear rationale for state intervention. George Stigler and Claire Friedland challenged this consensus in their classic 1962 paper, "What Can Regulators Regulate?", bringing together a classic Chicago School skepticism of regulation with a then-novel empirical approach that leveraged variation in regulatory policy across states.
