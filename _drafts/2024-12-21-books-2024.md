We welcomed our first child to the world last December. Consequently, I spent more time at home this year than I have since the pandemic, especially during my paternity leave and over the Summer. Only in the last few months have I regularly commuted to the department. Before the upheaval of an infant, I would have looked for a quiet workspace in my home office; now, I am more likely to find it in the drafty offices of Monroe Hall.

I've been thinking about how we choose the physical location and arrangement of our *workplace*. How do these inputs then affect productivity and creativity? Is there a trade-off between the short-run efficiency and convenience of remote work and long-run human capital development? And how does household structure interact with work location? In the spirit of these questions, I present some highlights from my reading this year, each of which addresses how where we work shapes what we think and do.
