We welcomed our first child to the world last December. Consequently, I spent more time at home this year than I have since the pandemic, especially during my paternity leave and over the Summer. Only in the last few months have I regularly commuted to the department. Before the upheaval of an infant, I would have looked to my home office for a quiet place to work; now, I am more likely to find it in the drafty offices of Monroe Hall.

I've been thinking about how we choose the physical location and arrangement of our *workplace*. How do these inputs then affect productivity and creativity? Is there a trade-off between the short-run efficiency and convenience of remote work and long-run human capital development? And how does household structure interact with work location? In the spirit of these questions, I present some highlights from my reading this year. Each of these books addresses how where we work shapes what we think.

- [The Transcendentalists and Their World](https://www.amazon.com/Transcendentalists-Their-World-Robert-Gross/dp/0374279322) (Robert Gross, 2021). The physical separation of work and home is a relatively recent phenomenon. What's new, compared to the 1800s, is the number of people who work *alone* -- that is, in a room by themselves. Thoreau was on the vanguard of this trend, settling down to his solitary stint at Walden pond in 1845. Had he continued his experiment to the year 1850, he would have "raised the number of solitary souls in Concord to four" in a town of 2,000. Ultimately, Thoreau's choice to live and work alone -- a fate otherwise reserved for childless widows -- gave his critique of the townspeople's materialism a moral weight that bears on his readers even today. In this case, more than others, the location of the work is inseparable from the work itself.

- [The Ladies' Paradise](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/54726) (Emile Zola, 1883) describes the triumph of the department store over traditional small shops in 19th-century Paris. Despite the suffering caused by this episode of creative destruction, the novel declines to make the department store an easy villain. The store brings fantastic opportunity to Denise, an orphan girl, who rises from the shop floor to management largely through her adaptability and work ethic (though catching the eye of the owner does not hurt her, either). The employees -- who rely on the store for their housing and food -- respond in a variety of ways to their employer's capricious demands. Some spend all their wages every weekend, drunk with a sense of freedom; others try to emulate the aristocratic customers on a shoestring budget; and still others think only of tearing down the employee above them in the hierarchy, just as the store itself devours the small shops of Paris. I read this book on [the recommendation of Jason Furman](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6497195146), who was looking for the rare positive depiction of capitalism in fiction.

- [Convenience Store Woman](https://www.amazon.com/Convenience-Store-Woman-Sayaka-Murata/dp/0802128254) (Sayaka Murata, 2018).

- [Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/1541675126) (Seymour Papert, 1980).
