# What I Learned

* The idea for Monte Carlo experiments came to the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam as he recovered from viral encephalitis in a hospital bed. While attempting to calculate the probability of victory in a game of solitaire using combinatorics, he realized that it would be much easier to "lay out 100 hands and simply observe and count the number of successful plays." Scientists at the Los Alamos project immediately applied the idea to simulating chain reactions as they developed the atomic bomb. From [The Man From the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Future-Visionary-Life-Neumann/dp/1324003995) by Ananyo Bhatttacharya (2021).

* During the early colonial era, the English colonies had no public official with responsibilities equivalent to the modern district attorney. Instead, the victim of a crime, or her relations, would seek justice themselves. The Dutch colony of New Amsterdam did include such a figure, called a *schout*, and from there the practice spread into the Enlish colonies. From [The Island at the Center of the World](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Center-World-Manhattan-Forgotten/dp/1400078679) by Russell Shorto (2004).

* At the beginning of the second century BC, King Eumenes II founded a library in Pergamum, a city in present day Turkey, to compete with the cultural brilliance of the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Ptolomy V was fiercely jealous of his capital's reputation, so he banned the export of papyrus to the upstart rival. In response, artisans in Pergamum developed the technology of writing on animal skins, which were called *pergamena*, or "parchment" in honor of their efforts. From [Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World](https://www.amazon.com/Papyrus-Invention-Books-Ancient-World/dp/0593318897) by Irene Vallejo (2022).

* Before the Revolutionary War, the state of Virginia supported an established Anglican church. Each parish provided their minister with a salary of 16,000 pounds of tobacco and a farm, or *glebe*. After independence, the state confiscated the glebes, and Thomas Jefferson secured the proceeds from the sale of two *glebes* in Albemarle County to finance the University of Virginia. From [Thomas Jefferson's Education](https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Jeffersons-Education-Alan-Taylor/dp/0393652424/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by Alan Taylor (2019).
