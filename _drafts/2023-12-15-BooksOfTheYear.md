* The idea for Monte Carlo experiments came to the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam as he recovered from viral encephalitis in a hospital bed. While attempting to calculate the probability of victory in a game of solitaire using combinatorics, he realized that it would be much easier to "lay out 100 hands and simply observe and count the number of successful plays." The idea was immediately applied to simulating chain reactions for the Los Alamos project.
